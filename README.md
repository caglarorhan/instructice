## General Info
Instructice is a library that allows you to create interactive demonstrations for any web application. It enables you to guide users through your application with user actions like events and information tooltips. All data and options are configurable through the `instructions.js` file.

## Technologies
Instructice is built using JavaScript and can be installed via npm.

## Installation
To install Instructice, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install instructice
```
## Usage
To use Instructice, you need to create an instructions.js file in your project. This file should export an object that defines the instructions for your demonstration. The instructions include various elements like text, images, buttons, and their associated actions. Each instruction can be configured to run with other instructions, have a backup, and end after a certain action or time.  Here's an example of what an instructions.js file might look like:

``` 
<script type="module">
    window.onerror = function(message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
        if (error && error.code === "MODULE_NOT_FOUND") {
            console.error(`The module ${source} could not be found.`);
        }
    };

    import("./src/instructice.js")
        .then(module => {
            let Instructice = module.default;
            let instructice = new Instructice();
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error(`An error occurred while importing the module: ${error}`);
        });
</script>
```
